# scidavis

Temporary SCM until the package returns to Fedora official repos.

In the meantime, you can get rpms for F25, F26 and rawhide from [this copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/alexpl/scidavis/).

As with every fedora spec file, this one is available under the terms of the MIT license.
